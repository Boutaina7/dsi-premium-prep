'''
We're observing ships on a bay. We see 5 types of ships: tankers, sailboats, yachts, cruise ships, transport.

There are rules in the bay that tankers cannot follow or precede cruise ships or yachts. Sailboats cannot precede or follow transport ships.

# What is the probability that there will be three sailboats in an observation of 5 ships?

# What is the probability of seeing 2 tankers and yacht in an observation of 5 ships?
