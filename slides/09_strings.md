# The `string` datatype
* Strings are simply a collection of characters
* However, in Python, a `string` is a scalar type and is immutable
* Strings are declared with single, double, or triple quotes. 
    * Mostly interchangeable. Single and double quotes only work with strings that span one line. 
    * Strings that span multiple lines need to be declared using triple quotes.
