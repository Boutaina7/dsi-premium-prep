# Geometric Probability Distribution
* Similar to binomial, but with no fixed value for $n$ 
* Represents a sequence of identical bernoulli trials before the first success

Example: We can apply the geometric PMF to determine the probability of having to flip a fair coin 5 times before a flip resulting in “heads” on the 6
