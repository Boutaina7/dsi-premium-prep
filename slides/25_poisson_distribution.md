# The Poisson Distribution

The Poisson Probability Distribution represents the number of events occuring in a given interval of time or space
* $\lambda$ represents the typical or expected frequency in a given interval

**Constraints:**
1. The rate represented by lambda is constant
2. Each “success” or event is independent, discrete, and random
3. Two events cannot occur at the exact same instant
