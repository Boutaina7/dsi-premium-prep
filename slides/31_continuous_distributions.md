# Continuous Random Variables
* Methods for determining expected values typically depend on the application of calculus (integration)
* Probabilities of continuous random variables are represented by Probability Density Functions (PDF)

# PDF vs PMF
* A PMF is able to produce probabilities for distinct values in the range
* A PDF does not give probabilities for distinct values, it produces probabilities over a given interval.

# Zero probability
In a continuous distribution, the probability of a single, exact outcome will be 0

Instead, we search for the probability within a range

$$
P(a \le x \le b)
$$

# Area under the Curve
The probability of a range of outcomes can be represented as the area under the curve for the plot of a probabilistic function.
* recall: $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}$

Can perform **integration** for integrable functions

Can apply Riehmann Sums approach for non-integrable functions

# Continuous Distributions
##### Uniform Continuous Distribution
Between some range, all values have equal probability

##### Exponential Distribution
Related to the Poisson distribution; where the Poisson distribution models “events per time (or area),” the exponential measure time (or space) in between events. Commonly used to model waiting times	

##### Normal Distribution
Normally distributed random variables have the iconic “bell-shaped” curve.

# Uniform Continuous
Consider a uniform continuous distribution between $0$ and $1$. 

The probability of drawing a random value less than $0.43$ can be expressed as

$$
P(x \lt 0.43) = \frac{0.43 - 0}{1.0 - 0.0}
$$

$$
P(x \lt 0.43) = 0.43
$$

NOTE: due to the infinite precision of a continuous distribution, $\lt$ and $\le$ are equivalent above.
