# A Simple, General Analytic Approach
Considering a stochastic process, model or create a sample space and analyze:
1. Synthesize outcomes, model a phenomenon, look at data
2. Observe values packed into a dictionary
3. Interpret or analyze

# Analysis through Counting
This can often be thought of as an "exhaustive" approach, for discrete outcomes, or a "bins" approach for continuous outcomes.

# Counting Example:
In a particular table top game, when in a battle, a player first rolls a 36-sided die, then pulls a card from a standard deck of cards. Finally, the player flips a coin three times.

1. Synthesize Outcomes by counting

```python
rolls = range(1,36+1)
suits = ['Spades ','Clubs','D','H']
card_nums = ['A']
```
