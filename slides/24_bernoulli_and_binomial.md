# Probability Distributions
Recall: A Random Variable (RV) can generally be thought of as representing the potential outcomes of a random experiment.

The frequency of occurrences of outcomes of a Random Variable can be thought of as a **Probability Distribution**. Note that a Probability Distribution is dependant on the definition of the RV.

# Discrete Probability Distribution
In this course we will consider four discrete probability distributions, in addition to the novel ones we define.

**Uniform Distribution**
For a given range of discrete outcomes, every outcome has equal probability. For example, a single fair die roll will have equal probability for any given side.

**Bernoulli Trial**
The result of an experiment with two mutually exclusive outcomes, commonly thought of as Failure or Success, with a parameter $p$ representing the probability of success.

**Binomial Distribution**
Represents the number of successes in a series of $n$ Bernoulli Trials with a fixed probability $p$

**Poisson Distribution**
Given an average frequency per span of time, area, or volume, referred to as lambda ($\lambda$), represents the probabilities of different numbers of events, given constraints of independence of events and identical distribution of events.

**Geometric Distribution**
Represents the number of Failures in Bernoulli Trials up to the First success. The probability $p$ for each Bernoulli trial is held constant.
