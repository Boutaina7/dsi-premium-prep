# Probability Distributions
Recall: A Random Variable (RV) can generally be thought of as representing the potential outcomes of a random experiment.

The frequency of occurrences of outcomes of a Random Variable can be thought of as a **Probability Distribution**. Note that a Probability Distribution is dependant on the definition of the RV.

# Discrete Probability Distribution
In this course we will consider four discrete probability distributions

**Uniform Distribution**
For a given range of discrete outcomes, every outcome has equal probability. For example, a single fair die roll will have equal probability for any given side.

**Bernoulli Trial**
The result of an experiment with two mutually exclusive outcomes, commonly thought of as Failure or Success, with a parameter $p$ representing the probability of success.

**Binomial Distribution**
Represents the number of successes in a series of $n$ Bernoulli Trials with a fixed probability $p$
