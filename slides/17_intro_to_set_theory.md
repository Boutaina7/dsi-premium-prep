# Random Experiments
An experiment or process for which the outcome is unknown
* Examples: 
    * Flipping a coin
    * Rolling a die
    * Inspector finds a manufacturing flaw on a given part
* If a specific outcome is guaranteed, we call it certain
* If a specific outcome can not happen, we call it impossible
* A certain or impossible outcome indicates that we may not be considering a random experiment

# Definition of a Set
* In mathematics, a set is a well-defined collection of objects
    * A set is also an object in itself
* Sets must be comprised of unique objects: **NO DUPLICATES**
* If the outcome of a random experiment is unknown, and all of the possible outcomes are predictable in nature, this set of outcomes is known as the **Sample Space**, notated with a capital $S$, or as the “Universal Set”,  denoted $U$, or $\Omega$ (capital omega)

---------------------------------------------------------------
# Sample Space
* Each possible outcome of a random experiment is known as a **sample point**
    * Example: The set of possible sample points for the rolling of a fair six-sided die:
        * $S$ = Sample Space = { ⚀, ⚁, ⚂, ⚃, ⚄, ⚅ } 

NOTE: the word **pip** refers to a single dot on a die, thus ⚄ has 5 pips.

# Subsets aka Events
In the terms of probability theory, **subsets** of the sample space are collections of sample points which are referred to as **Events**.

$S$ = Sample Space = { ⚀, ⚁, ⚂, ⚃, ⚄, ⚅ }

Example: For the sample space $S$ here are some examples:
* $A$ = The event in which the resulting number of pips showing is greater than 3
* $B$ = The event in which the resulting number of pips showing is even
* $C$ = The event in which the resulting number of pips showing is exactly 3

NOTE: Events are commonly represented by capital letters, starting at the beginning of the alphabet.

# Venn Diagrams
Venn Diagrams are often used to visualize sets, set operations, and probabilities.
