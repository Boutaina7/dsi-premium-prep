# Review: Strings
* Strings are simply a collection of characters
* Strings are declared with single, double, and triple quotes. 
    * Mostly interchangeable. Single and double quotes only work with strings that span one line. 
    * Strings that span multiple lines need to be declared using triple quotes.

# BREAKOUT (10 minutes)
Create a function that takes in a string. This function should split the string into a list of lowercase words that make up that string. Return a list of unique ‘cleaned’ words.
* Challenge: strip any punctuation (for now, strip commas and periods)
* Challenge: remove the common english words from the list below you are returning

```python
remove_punct_lst =  [",", ".", ";", ":", "!", "?", "'", '"']

Remove_word_lst = ["i", "me", "my", "myself", "we", "our", "ours", "ourselves", "you", "your", "yours", "yourself", "yourselves", "he", "him", "his", "himself", "she", "her", "hers", "herself", "it", "its", "itself", "they", "them", "their", "theirs", "themselves", "what", "which", "who", "whom", "this", "that", "these", "those", "am", "is", "are", "on", "off", "over", "under", "again", "further", "then", "once", "here", "there", "when", "where", "why", "how", "all", "any", "both", "each", "few", "more", "most", "other", "some", "such", "no", "nor", "not", "only", "own", "same", "so", "than", "too", "very", "can", "will", "just", "don", "should", "now"]

String to use: "Hello there! How are you? Why don’t you take a seat over there? Once we went to the store and we found ourselves in a strange place. We ran into two people. They were very interesting to talk to. Each of them had an interesting accent and we wondered where they were from."
